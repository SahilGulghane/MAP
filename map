map is data structure

map consists of key and value pair . data is called as pair of key and value .
an key must be uniqe allways while that of value not need to be uniqe

there are three types of map
1.Hashmap
this map is used to make key and value pair to it store in random way
ex : sahil
key value
h    1
i    1
l    1
s    1
a    1

2. LinkedHashmap
this map is used to store data as same scan from an array
ex :sahil

key  value
s    1
a    1
h    1
i    1
l    1


3.Treemap
this map is used to store keys in sorted(ascending manner) from an array

ex sahil

key  value
a    1
h    1
i    1
l    1
s    1

.. create an object of clase in java


MAP<data type of key,data type of value > object name = Hashmap<>();
MAP<data type of key,data type of value > object name = LinkedHashmap<>();
MAP<data type of key,data type of value > object name = Treemap<>();


obeject name . put(location,value);
to put data

too get value
variable = map.get(arr[1])

this methodes check weather key contain in table allready if true then it will not enter
map.containsKey(location])
